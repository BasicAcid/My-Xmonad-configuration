# my-xmonad-configuration

I won't update this repo regularly, because I use an org file to manage my dotfiles, and at the moment I don't plan to release it because it contains too much unrelated notes that only I can understand.

But anyway, here is my Xmonad conf, maybe that could be helpful to someone :)
